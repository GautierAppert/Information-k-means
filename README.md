# Information-k-means

* This repository contains the slides to some of my presensation I gave during the PhD seminar at ENSAE.
This is joint work with Olivier Catoni.

* We propose a new unsupervised clustering procedure called **Information k-means**. It can be seen
as a usual k-means procedure using the Kullback divergence as a distortion measure.
However, the minimization is performed with respect to the first argument of the Kullback divergence, 
which leads to very different centroid computed as geometric means.
